# Short programs

These are some short programs that help to visualize data

```bash
  # corrcov.py creates a correlation covariance heatmap
  corrcov.py [plot_matrix*.dat file]

  # I don't really know what correlation_matirx.sh does

  # covar.py is the old program that used to be what I used to do correlations matrices
  covar.py [covariance file from riina]

  # disp.py will show displacements in a graph. There is no limit to how many sets of data that can be used with this program
  disp.py [file1] [file2] ...

  # domrmsd.py is a python program that creates the rmsds from eigenvector data files
  # the rmsds are collected by comparing one pdb file to another
  domrmsd.py [file]

  # lastline.com is crazy. i don't really know what the point of that one is

  # mathematica_correlation_matirx.sh is a program that will take 3 columns of vector data (xyz) and make a square that can be used for covariance plots
  mathematica_correlation_matirx.sh

  # pyoverlap.py is a python program to make the overlap graphs
  pyoverlap.py [file1] [file2]...

  #pyrmsd.py is another program to display rmsd

  # rmsd.com is a command for rmsds

  # i have no clue what sep3lines does. probably nothing
```
